Google maps v3 plugin for jQuery and jQuery Mobile

The Google Map version 3 plugin for jQuery and jQM takes away some of the head aches from working with the Google Map API. Instead of having to use Google event listeners for simple events like click, you can use jQuery click events on the map and markers.

It is also very flexible, highly customizable, lightweight (3.2kB or 3.9kB for the full) and works out of the box with jQuery mobile. But one of its best features (atleast for SEO people) is that you can populate a map from microformats, RDFa or microdata on your site, which can be used as a fallback when a user doesn't have javascript enabled.

## Usage

Install with Meteor 0.9.0 and above:

```
$ meteor add jackyqiu:meteor-jquery-ui-map
```
